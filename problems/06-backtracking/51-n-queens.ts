/**
 * 51. N-Queens
 * Difficulty: Hard
 *
 * The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard
 * such that no two queens attack each other.
 *
 * Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
 * You may return the answer in any order.
 *
 * Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement,
 * where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: n = 4
 *   Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
 *   Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle.
 *     Solution 1:         Solution 2:
 *     . Q . .             . . Q .
 *     . . . Q             Q . . .
 *     Q . . .             . . . Q
 *     . . Q .             . Q . .
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: n = 1
 *   Output: [["Q"]]
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   - 1 <= n <= 9
 *
 * Approach: Backtracking
 *   - Place queens row by row.
 *   - For each row, try placing a queen in each column.
 *   - Track which columns, diagonals (row - col), and anti-diagonals (row + col)
 *     are already occupied using sets.
 *   - If a valid placement is found for all rows, record the solution.
 *   - Backtrack by removing the queen and trying the next column.
